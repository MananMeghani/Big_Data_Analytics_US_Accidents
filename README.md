# Big_Data_Analytics_US_Accidents
This code was presented as a final project for IST 716 at Syracuse University. The dataset had around 3 million rows of data thus, Apache Spark has been used for analysis using the online databricks platform.

Despite exercising safety rules, the number of deaths caused due to road accidents in the US does not stay constant or go down, instead it is pretty high. With this project we are trying to identify factors which contribute most to the accidents and the hot spots for accidents in those states. Furthermore, we have analyzed the conditions that make these spots more prone to accidents than other spots. We have also built classification models to predict the severity of accidents.

We used the Chi Squared values for classification of data and correlation coefficient for numeric data to predict inter-dependency amongst variables. The dataset we have used is huge and hence required certain steps of cleaning and processing to bring it into the format suitable for data visualization and optimal model building. We further proceeded to implement Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Tree, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. Each model provided us with different accuracies and helped us determine the best model to predict severity of accidents.

Road accidents have become very common these days. Nearly 1.25 million people die in road crashes each year, on average, 3,287 deaths a day. Moreover, 20–50 million people are injured or disabled annually. Road traffic crashes rank as the 9th leading cause of death and accounts for 2.2% of all deaths globally. Road crashes cost USD 518 billion globally, costing individual countries from 1– 2% of their annual GDP.

In the USA, over 37,000 people die in road crashes each year, and 2.35 million are injured or disabled. Road crashes cost the U.S. $230.6 billion per year or an average of $820 per person. Road crashes are the single greatest annual cause of death of healthy U.S. citizens travelling abroad.

US-Accidents can be used for numerous applications and we have implemented casualty analysis and have tried to study the impact of environmental stimuli on accident occurrence. And here we are, sharing our results.
